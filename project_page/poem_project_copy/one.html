      <p>While beneath the ocean I met with the captain
      <br>
      Who sank to the floor on his ship
      <br>
      All of his passengers escaped to safety
      <br><br><br>
      But he was not done with his trip
      <br><br><br>
      He looked up and smiled, asked me how do you do?
      <br>
      I told him I'm losing my grip
      <br>
      He told me Son, if you want to hold onto yourself
      <br>
      then let yourself slip</p>
      <br><br><br>
