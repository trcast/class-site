    <br>  <h1 class="white">While beneath the ocean I met with the captain  <br>

        <br> Who sank to the floor on his ship  <br>

        <br> All of his passengers escaped to safety  <br>

      <br>   But he was not done with his trip  <br>

      <br>He looked up and smiled, asked me how do you do?<br>

      <br>I told him I'm losing my grip<br>

      <br>He told me son, if you want to hold onto yourself<br>

      <br>Then let yourself slip</h1>
