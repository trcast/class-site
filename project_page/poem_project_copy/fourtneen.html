<h1> <br><br><br><br><br>While beneath the ocean I met with the captain
  <br><br>Who sank to the floor on his ship
  <br><br>All of his passengers escaped to safety
  <br><br>But he was not done with his trip
  <br><br>He looked up and smiled, asked me how do you do?
  <br><br>I told him I'm losing my grip
  <br><br>He told me son, if you want to hold onto yourself
  <br><br>Then let yourself slip
