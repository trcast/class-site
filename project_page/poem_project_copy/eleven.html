    <h1 class="one"> While beneath the ocean I met with the captain</h1>

    <h1 class="two"> Who sank to the floor on his ship
    </h1>

    <h1 class="three">All of his passengers escaped to safety</h1>

    <h1 class="four">But he was not done with his trip
</h1>

    <h1 class="one">He looked up and smiled, asked me how do you do?</h1>

    <h1 class="two">I told him I'm losing my grip</h1>

    <h1 class="three">He told me son, if you want to hold onto yourself</h1>


    <h1 class="four">Then let yourself slip</h1>
