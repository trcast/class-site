    <h3>  While beneath the ocean I met with the captain </h3>
    Who <em>sank</em> to the floor on his ship

    <h3>  All of his passengers escaped to safety</h3>
    But he <em>was not done</em> with his trip

      <h3>He looked up and smiled, asked me how do you do? </h3>
      told him I'm losing my grip

    <h3> He told me son, if you want to hold onto <em>yourself</em> </h3>
    Then let yourself slip
